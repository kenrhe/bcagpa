        Hi! <br />     Welcome to my "BCA GPA Calculator" app developed with a JETTY framework. <br />Here are some common questions that are asked:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How accurate is this application?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        This app is extremely accurate and uses a GPA calculation formula provided by guidance. 
        <br />It does not count classes with tildes (~) (aka non GPA classes such as gym). 
        <br />Every factor has been accounted for. The year GPA displayed will be accurate within 0.05 points.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>I believe there is an error within your app. Where can I report it?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        If you believe that there is an error within my app, feel free to e-mail me at hwarhe@bergen.org.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>I have a suggestion, where can I contact you?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        If you have a suggestion, feel free to message me on facebook or e-mail me at hwarhe@bergen.org.
